R_HW contains a summary of budget and energy and climate spending by different departments through time.

Packages needed: tidyverse

First three plots are summary plots of each respective CSV file: energy spending, climate spending, and budget of various departments.

I then looked at the relationship between NSF budget and NSF GCC Spending using a linear regression, and plotted this with the R2 and significant p-value.

Lastly, I looked at the relationship between NSF budget and energy spending of Bio and Env Sciences, and plotted this with the R2 and nonsignificant p-value.
